## Problem 1

```{r}
set.seed(1)
problem_1_df = tibble(
  vec_numerical = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_numerical > 2,
  vec_char = c("Courtney", "Patrick", "Evelyn", "Glenn", "Sue", "Glen", "Jenny", "Kayla", "Lindsay", "Derick"),
  vec_factor = c("female", "male", "female", "male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "female", "male")
)

numerical_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_numerical)
logical_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_logical)
char_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_char)
factor_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_factor)
```

## What works and doesn't work when taking means?

The mean(x) function works for the numerical and logical vectors, but not for the character and factor vectors.
