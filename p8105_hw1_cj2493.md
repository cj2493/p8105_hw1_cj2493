Problem 1
---------

``` r
set.seed(1)
problem_1_df = tibble(
  vec_numerical = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_numerical > 2,
  vec_char = c("Courtney", "Patrick", "Evelyn", "Glenn", "Sue", "Glen", "Jenny", "Kayla", "Lindsay", "Derick"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("female", "male", "female", "male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "female", "male"))
)

numerical_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_numerical)
logical_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_logical)
char_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem_1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
factor_mean = mean(problem_1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem_1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

### What works and doesn't work when taking means?

The mean(x) function works for the numerical and logical vectors, but not for the character and factor vectors.

### What happened?

The logical and factor vectors were converted to a numeric vector, but the character vector was not.

``` r
char_to_factor = factor(problem_1_df$vec_char)
convert_char_2 = as.numeric(char_to_factor)
factor_to_char = as.character(problem_1_df$vec_factor)
convert_factor_2 = as.numeric(factor_to_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

### What happened?

Now, the character vector was successfully converted to a numeric vector with a factor step in the middle. However, now we cannot convert the factor vector to numeric via a character step in the middle.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
set.seed(1)
problem_2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  is_positive = x + y > 0,
  is_positive_num = as.numeric(is_positive),
  is_positive_factor = factor(is_positive_num)
)
```

### Description of the Vector

The size of the dataset is 1000 by 1000. The mean of x is -0.0116481 and the median of x is -0.0353242. The proportion of cases for which the logical vector is true is 0.49.

``` r
logical_plot = ggplot(problem_2_df, aes(x = y, y = x, color = is_positive)) + geom_point()
numeric_plot = ggplot(problem_2_df, aes(x = y, y = x, color = is_positive_num)) + geom_point()
factor_plot = ggplot(problem_2_df, aes(x = y, y = x, color = is_positive_factor)) + geom_point()
